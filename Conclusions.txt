During this project I explored AI agents in the game world. Not only was this a fun and entertaining experience, it allowed me to get familiar with algorithms such as minimax. Although I had a theoretical understanding of this algorithm prior to taking upon this project, I was taken aback by the complexity of its execution. On the other hand, alpha-beta pruning was a concept that was harder to grasp, but implementing its procedure on my own helped me truly understand the algorithm.

In addition to this, I would like to add that the caching and depth implementations were nothing short of a joyful experience. In all honesty, it was mind-blowing to see how such simple code can make such a large difference in efficiency. This project has also gave me first-hand experience with memory vs time complexity tradeoffs.
